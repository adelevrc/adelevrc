    "title": "My Story: Feeling Better Through Yoga",
    "p1": "In 2014, I discovered yoga, a practice that transformed my life. At the time, I was going through a tough period, dealing with a lot of anxiety, panic attacks, and insomnia. I was looking for a way to regain a sense of well-being and manage my daily life.",
    "p2": "One evening, I decided to follow a yoga session on YouTube, and in just 15 minutes, I felt the benefits of movement, conscious breathing, and meditation. My anxious thoughts disappeared, and that night, I slept peacefully. For almost a year, I practiced yoga every evening, and little by little, I started to feel better, improving both my sleep quality and daily life.",
    "p3": "However, I felt the need to understand what was happening within me during these sessions. I then delved into research on the brain, neuroscience, the benefits of breathing, meditation, as well as anatomy and biomechanics. The more I deepened my research, the more I fell in love with yoga as a whole: a practice that combines movement, anatomy, and mind.",

      "title1": "The Science of Movement and Yoga",
      "p1": "What fascinated me was discovering the impact of yoga on the brain and body. Yoga is not just a series of postures; in addition to the traditional and ritualistic aspects, it is a science of movement that takes into account biomechanics, neuroscience, and how our body and mind are part of the same entity. Through this practice, I learned to manage my stress and emotions, reconnect, and better handle the challenges of daily life.",
      "title2": "My Training at Alba Yoga",
      "p2": "In 2024, after a long search for a program that combines the science of movement, anatomy, and the philosophy of yoga, I graduated from the Alba Yoga Academy. Under the guidance of Celest Perreira and Hannah Barrett, two internationally recognized figures, I deepened my understanding of the connections between yoga, anatomy, and neuroscience to create original, dynamic sequences with specific goals.",
      "p3": "Today, I am convinced that everyone can benefit from yoga, whether you run, lift weights, do Pilates, or do nothing at all. Yoga is there as a friend, helping us improve our body, health, well-being, as well as managing our emotions and living in society.",
